"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

Trying to answer, you must say something that is unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.

Technological progress can take two forms. 0 -> 1 or 1 -> N.

- 0 -> 1 refers to vertical progress, you must make something new.
- 0 -> N, horizontal progress. Copying what already works and distributing it to a larger audience of people. (Globalization)

In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable. Today our challenge is to both image and create the new technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than the 20th.

New technology tends to come from new ventures - startups. Bureaucratic hierarchies move too slowly for any real progress to happen. A company's most important strength is new thinking.
