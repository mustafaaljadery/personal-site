description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

No company has a culture; every company is a culture. A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside. 

Since time is your most valuable asset, it's odd to spend it working with people who don't envision any long-term future together. Stronger relationships doesn't only make the team happier but makes the workspace better. 

You need people who are not just skilled on paper but who will work together cohesively after they're hired. Talented people don't need to work for you; they have plenty of options. You should highlight your mission and you should highlight your team. "Are these the kind of people I want to work with?"

From the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way. You should make your early staff as personally similar as possible. You need every new hire to be equally obsessed. 

On the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work. Make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee's one thing was unique, and evaluations would just be on that one thing. Entreprenues should take cultures of extreme dedication seriously.
