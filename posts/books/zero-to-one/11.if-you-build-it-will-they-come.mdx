Even though sales are everywhere, most people underrate its importance. Customers will not come just because you build it. You have to solve the distribution problem.

Advertising doesn't exist to make you buy a product right away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. It takes hard work to make sales look easy. 

All salesmen are actions: their priority is persuasion, not sincerity. Like acting, sales works best when hidden. The engineer's grail is a product great enough that "it sells itself." If you invented something new but you haven't invested in an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business - no matter how good the product is.

Superior sales and distribution by themselves can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation. The converse is not true. 

There are only two metrics that matter when it comes to sales, Customer Lifetime Value, and Customer Acquisition Cost. Advertising only works for startups when the customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value make every other distribution channel uneconomical.

A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too. Whoever is first to dominate the most important segment of a market with viral potential will be the last mover in the whole market. 

Distribution follows a power law of its own. One of these distribution methods will be a lot better than the others. Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. Try to get as much press as possible it's good for getting investments, and for hiring.
