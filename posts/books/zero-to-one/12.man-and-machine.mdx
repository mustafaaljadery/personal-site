title: Man and Machine 
description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

You have to truly understand the difference between a man and a machine. Delegate tasks with this way of thinking. Man are better at some things. Machines better at another. Set out to transform how one person does their job, don't set out to replace that person. How can computers help humans solve hard problems?
