description: A great technology company should have proprietary technology which is an order of magnitude better than its nearest substitute. Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user. Only when your product is 10x better can you offer the customer transparent superiority.

Questions every business should answer
1. Engineering: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. Timing: Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. Monopoly: Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. People: Do you have the right team?
5. Distribution: Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
6. Durability: Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
7. Secret: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?

A great technology company should have proprietary technology which is an order of magnitude better than its nearest substitute. Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user. Only when your product is 10x better can you offer the customer transparent superiority.

Entering a slow-moving market can be a good strategy, but only if you have a definite and realistic plan to take it over. Customers won't care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a superior way. And if you can't monopolize a unique solution for a small market, you'll be stuck with vicious competition. 

Doing something different is what's truly good for society - and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.
