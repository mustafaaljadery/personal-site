description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

A great technology company should have proprietary technology an order of magnitude better than its nearest subsitute. Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user. Only when your product is 10x better can you offer the customer transparent superiority.

Entering a slow-moving market can be a good strategy, but only if you have a definite and realistic plan to take it over. Customers won't care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a superior way. And if you can't monopolize a unique solution for a small market, you'll be stuck with vicious competition. 

Doing something different is what' truly good for society - and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.
