description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

What does everybody agree on? "Madness is rare in individuals - but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule. (Nitzsche)" Identify a delusional popular belief to find a contrarian truth. 

The Dot-com mania from September 1998 -> March 2000 was Silicon Valley's gold rush: money was everywhere. 

Peter's Four Lessons from the Dot-Com Crash
1. Make incremental advances. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward. 
2. Stay lean and flexible. You shoulld try things out, "iterate," and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.  
3. Improve on the competition. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already exisiting customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful companies. 
4. Focus on product, not sales. If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it's not good enough: technology is primarly about product development, not distribution.

The opposite is also true to all of these lessons. The most contrarian thing to all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.
