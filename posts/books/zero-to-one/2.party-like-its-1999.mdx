What does everybody agree on? "Madness is rare in individuals - but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule. (Nitzsche)" Identify a delusional popular belief to find a contrarian truth. 

The Dot-com mania from September 1998 -> March 2000 was Silicon Valley's gold rush: money was everywhere. 

Peter's Four Lessons from the Dot-Com Crash
1. Make incremental advances. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward. 
2. Stay lean and flexible. You should try things out, "iterate," and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.  
3. Improve the competition. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful companies. 
4. Focus on product, not sales. If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it's not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.

The opposite is also true in all of these lessons. The most contrarian thing to all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.
