description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

What valuable company is nobody building? Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create. There are two types of businesses, those in perfect competition and monopolies. 

A company can only become a monopoly if it offers something so good that no other firm can substitute for the product. If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentitated commodity business. 

Monopolists lie to protect themselves. Bragging invites scrutiny and attacks. Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: "we're in a league of our own." Entrepreneurs are always biased ot understate teh scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. 

Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. Businesses are not interchangeable atoms, they are unique creators. Every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others canoot.
