What valuable company is nobody building? Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create. There are two types of businesses, those in perfect competition and monopolies. 

A company can only become a monopoly if it offers something so good that no other firm can substitute for the product. If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.

Monopolists lie to protect themselves. Bragging invites scrutiny and attacks. Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: "we're in a league of our own." Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. 

Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. Businesses are not interchangeable atoms, they are unique creators. Every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot.
