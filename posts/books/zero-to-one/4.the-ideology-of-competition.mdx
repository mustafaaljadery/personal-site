title: The Ideology of Competition 
description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandements. It's competition not business that is like war. Competition is war. War is costly. Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist. 

If you can recorgnize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you're already more sane than most.
