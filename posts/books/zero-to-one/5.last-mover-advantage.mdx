Escaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can endure the future. The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. 

Many entrepreneurs focus on the short-term profits of a company, however, they should be focusing on durability. If you focus on short-term profits, you forget the important question "will this company still be around a decade from now?"

Peter Thiel's Characteristics of a Monopoly
1. Proprietary Technology: This is the most substantive advantage to a company because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Example: Google's search algorithms. As a rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. The easiest way to gain this advantage is to invest in something new. 
2. Network Effects: The product is more useful as more people use it. You will never reap a network effect unless your product is valuable to the first few users. 
3. Economies of Scale: The marginal cost of producing another copy of the product has to be lower as more and more people use the product. Tech products are amazing at this. 
4. Branding: This is the weakest of monopoly advantages, however, can be huge. The best companies at branding are luxury brands. Your underlying technology must support the detail of your branding. No technology company can be built on branding alone.

How to Build a Monopoly 
- Smart Small and Monopolize: Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. As a result, you should start by dominating a large share of a small market and expand from there. Attempting to attack a big market with lots of competitors goes back to the competition is war theory. The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. 
- Scaling Up: Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. You must dominate a niche and then scale to adjacent markets - that must be part of the founding narrative. 
- Don't Disrupt: disruptors are people who look for trouble and find it. As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible. 

Moving first in a market is a tactic, not a goal. It's much better to be the last mover in a market where you end all existing competition. Dominate a small niche and scale from there. Business is like chess: "You must study the endgame before everything else."
