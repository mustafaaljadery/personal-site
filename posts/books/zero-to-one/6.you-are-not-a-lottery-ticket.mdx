Many may believe in luck, however, if you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, you wouldn't even be reading Zero to One. 

If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it. 

Picking a project with a lot of underline definites will be one of your main ingredients to success. Software startups are amazing because code is determinate, engineering is definite, there is very little regulation (compared to other fields), code is very well understood, and it's very cheap to write software. 

U.S households are saving almost nothing. And U.S companies are letting cash pile up on their balance sheets without investing in new projects because they don't have any concrete plans for the future. 

Why should you expect your business to succeed without a plan to make it happen?

The Return of Design: Anyone who has held an iDevice or a smoothly machined MacBook has felt the result of Steve Job's obsession with visual and experimental perfection. However, the greatest thing Jobs designed was his business. 

Forget "minimum viable products", Jobs saw that to change the world, you must carefully plan. You should not listen to the focus group of feed or copy others' successes. A business with a  good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you have definite mastery. You start by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
