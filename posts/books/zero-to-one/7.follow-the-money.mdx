description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

We don't live in a normal world; we live under a power law. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest fo the fund combined. 

Once you think that you're playing the lottery, you've already psychologically prepared yourself to lose. 

Every single person is an investor. An entreprenuer is making a major investment by spending his/her time working on a startup. Every entreprenur msut think about whether her company is going to succeed and become valuable.

It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. You can't trust a world that denises the power law to accurately fram your decisions for you, so what's most important is rarely obvious.
