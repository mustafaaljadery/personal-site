Every one of today's most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown or unsuspected. Most people act as if there were no secrets left to find. 

If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn't look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right - is extremely hard.

Very few people take unorthodox ideas seriously today, and the mainstream sees that as a sign of progress. If you think something hard is impossible, you'll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth. 

The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. 

There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don't know about themselves or things they hide because they don't want others to know. 

What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you? Secrets about people are relatively underappreciated. What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden?

The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it's rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything you know. You should only tell your secrets to whomever you need to and no more. Every great business is built around a secret that is hidden from the outside. The road does not need to be infinite take the hidden paths.
