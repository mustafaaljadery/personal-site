Right at the beginning. A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. As a founder, your first jon is to get the first thigns right, becuase you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.

Choosing a co-founder is like getting married and founder conflict is just as ugly as divorce. Your founding team must consist of impeccable technical ability and cofounders must have complementary skill sets. 

You need good people who get along but you also needa structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.

The worst thing you can do is keep your board large. Your board should consist of 3 people. If you want an effective board, keep it small. 

Everyone you involve in your company sholuld be involved full-time. Anyone who doesn't own stock options or draw a regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned. People are their on the bus or they are off the bus. 

A company does better the less it pays the CEO. In no case should a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per year in salary. The CEO must set the example by taking the lowest salary in the company.

Equity is the one form of compensation that can effectively orient people toward creating value in the future. For equity to create commitment rather than conflict, you must allocate it very carefully. Giving everyone equal shares is a mistake. Moreover, people often find equity unattractive.
