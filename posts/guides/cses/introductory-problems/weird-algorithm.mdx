## Description
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
3 &rarr; 10 &rarr; 5 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1
</div>

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of 

## Input

The only input line contains an integer <span className="font-medium">n</span>.

## Output

Print a line that contains all values of <span className="font-medium"> n </span> during the algorithm.

## Constraints
- 1 &le; n &le; 10^6

## Example
### Input:
- 3
### Output: 
- 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 


## Solution
<div className="flex flex-col items-center mt-8 mb-8 md:mt-12 md:mb-12">
  <Image src="/carbon-test.png" height={337.5} width={600}/>
</div>
